# Second-Repository
ok, this is getting tiring but i have no choice but to create this second repository. apparently, my git, github, and R studio are all linked together now and this is supposed to test it. im just glad i can follow through this class depite my initial skeptism with online education. This proves that junior is not the only genieus in the family. I too, am a genius
